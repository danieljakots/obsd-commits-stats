# obsd-commits-stats

Someone said about OpenBSD commits:

> ~50% of the commit messages is less than 10 characters long
> ~ 75% of them are less than 20 characters.

I was really surprised because that's not what I see. I wanted to see by myself
if it was true or not.

It's a WIP, this README will be updated as things progress.
